Hello Professor!

Ample progress has been made on the compiler since the last submission.
I will be starting the semantic checker soon. I did mean to have it written yesterday, but I had to make upgrades to the symbol table before I could begin the semantic checker. I feel that the remainder should prove straightforward, but I just need to get around challenges of linking each part into the grammar. We shall get this done soon though. 

Thank you for your help!

Brad
